For optimization problems...

\noindent {\large \textbf{Example 1: Area}}

\noindent \small Sarah has a new puppy and she wants to maximize her outdoor time, so she builds her a fenced-in play area. She has 40 feet of fencing,
and she wants to fence off a rectangular area next to her house. The house will be one side of the play area, so that side needs no fencing. In order
for the puppy to have adequate space, the area needs to be at least 5  feet long and 5 feet wide. What is the largest area she could have? Is there a
smallest area she could have if she wants to use all 40 feet of fencing?

\noindent {\large \textbf{Example 2: Distance}}

\noindent {\small A fence 8ft tall runs parellel to a tall building at a distance of 4ft from the building. What is the length of the shortest ladder
    that will reach from the ground over the fence to the wall of the building?}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Example2Pic.JPG}
\end{center}

\noindent Once we draw/sketch the problem out, we must create an equation that will relate all of the variables. Note that we are minimizing $z$ (shortest ladder).
We have a right angled triangle, so we can use the \textbf{pythagorean theorem}.

\begin{center}
    $z^2=y^2+(4+x)^2$
\end{center}

\noindent This equation does not help as of right now as it contains two variables, we need it in terms of one variable. Let's use what else we are given - the smaller triangle.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Example2Pic2.JPG}
\end{center}

\noindent These two triangles are \textbf{similar}, so we can use proportions to help us solve for y in terms of x.

\begin{center}
    \large{$\frac{y}{8}=\frac{4+x}{x}$ \\
    $yx = 8(4+x)$ \\
    $y=[\frac{8(4+x)}{x}]$}
\end{center}

\noindent Now, we can use this equation in the original equation we found at the start to get it in terms of one variable. It is very important to note
that if \textbf{z is minimized, $z^2$ is also minimized}. This is important because instead of isolating for $z^2$ and getting a square root on the other
side (which will be annoying to take the derivative of), we can simply take the derivative of $z^2$ and find the critical points.

\begin{center}
    $z^2=(\frac{8(4+x)}{x})^2+(4+x)^2$ \\
    $(z^2)'=2(\frac{8(4+x)}{x})(\frac{-32}{x^2})+2(4+x)$ \\
    $0=2(\frac{8(4+x)}{x})(\frac{-32}{x^2})+2(4+x)$ \\
    $-2(4+x)=2(\frac{8(4+x)}{x})(\frac{-32}{x^2})$ \\
    $2=2(\frac{8(4+x)}{x})(\frac{32}{x^2})$ \\
    $4+x=(\frac{8(4+x)}{x})(\frac{32}{x^2})$ \\
    $1=(\frac{8}{x})(\frac{32}{x^2})$ \\
    $1=(\frac{256}{x^3})$ \\
    $x=\sqrt[3]{256}$
\end{center}

\noindent \textbf{DOMAIN CHECK TODO}We need to make sure that this critical point is actually the minimum value. Let's do the 1st derivative test - plug in two numbers
into the derivative: one lower (4) and one higher (8) than $\sqrt[3]{256}$.

\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{center}
        \underline{$x=4$} \\
        $=2(\frac{8(6)}{4})(\frac{-32}{16})+2(8)$ \\
        $=$ negative

        \columnbreak
        \underline{$x=8$}\\
        $=2(\frac{8(12)}{8})(\frac{-32}{64})+2(12)$ \\
        $=$ positive
    \end{center}
\end{multicols}

\noindent By drawing what we found from the 1st derivative test, we can assume that at $x=\sqrt[3]{256}$, it is a minimum. Now let's find out the $y$ value.

\begin{center}
    $z^2=(\frac{8((\sqrt[3]{256})+4)}{\sqrt[3]{256}})^2+((\sqrt[3]{256})+4)^2$ \\
    $z^2=277.15$ \\
    $z=\sqrt{277.15}$ \\
    $z=16.65$
\end{center}

\noindent $\therefore$ The length of the shortest ladder that will reach will be $16.65$ft long.

\vspace*{5mm}

\noindent {\large \textbf{Example 3: Revenue}}

\noindent\small{The manager of a 100-unit apartment complex knows from experience that all units will be occupied if the rent is \$800 per month. A market survey suggests
    that, on average, one additional unit will remain vacant for each \$10 increase in rent. What rent should the manager charge to maximize revenue?}

\begin{center}
    Revenue = units sold x price per unit \\
    $R(x) = x \cdot p(x)$
\end{center}

\noindent We will need to find an expression for $p(x)$. Note that for every \$10 increase in price, there will be a 1 unit decrease. This is a contant/linear relationship: $-10$ slope.

\begin{center}
    $p(x) = -10x + b$
\end{center}

\noindent We are also given that the price of the units will be \$800 when all 100 units are being used.

\begin{center}
    $p(100)=800$
\end{center}

\noindent Bringing these two equations together we get:

\begin{center}
    $800=-10(100)+b$ \\
    $800=-1000+b$ \\
    $b=1800$ \\
    $\therefore p(x)=-10x+1800$
\end{center}

\noindent We can then use $p(x)$ in our original equation:

\begin{center}
    $R(x) = x \cdot p(x)$ \\
    $R(x)=x \cdot (-10x+1800)$ \\
    $R(x)=-10x^2+1800x$ \\
    $R'(x)=-20x+1800$
\end{center}

\noindent We can, as always, find the critical points by finding the x-values that make this equal to zero.

\begin{center}
    $0 =-20x+1800$ \\
    $-1800=-20x$ \\
    $x=90$ \\
\end{center}

\noindent To verify that this is the maximum, we need to plug in the endpoints of the domain as well (EVT): $0\leq x \leq 100$.

\begin{multicols}{3}
    \begin{center}
        $R(0)=-10(0)^2+1800(0)$ \\
        $R(0)=\$0$
        \columnbreak

        $R(90)=-10(90)^2+1800(90)$ \\
        $R(90)=-81000+162000$ \\
        $R(90)=\$81000$
        \columnbreak

        $R(100)=-10(100)^2+1800(100)$ \\
        $R(100)=-100000+180000$ \\
        $R(100)=\$80000$
    \end{center}
\end{multicols}

\noindent The maximum revenue will be \$81000 when 90 units are sold, so to find price per unit we need to divide revenue by number of units.

\begin{center}
    Revenue = units sold $\cdot$ price per unit \\
    Price per unit = revenue/units sold \\
    $= \frac{81000}{90}$ \\
    $=900$
\end{center}

\noindent $\therefore$ The manager should charge a \textbf{\$900} rent per month to maximize revenue to a value of \$81000.

\section{Related Rates}\index{Related Rates}

For related rates...

\vspace*{5mm}

\noindent {\large \textbf{Example 1: Area of Circle}}

\noindent When a circular metal plate is heated in an over, its radius increases at the rate of 0.02 cm/min. At what rate is the plate's area increasing
when the radius is 60cm?

\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent As always, let's first draw/sketch it out so we can have an easier time understanding the problem and what it is asking for: what rate the plate's area
is increasing \textbf{at the instant} (A.T.I) the radius is 60cm.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Example3Pic.jpg}
\end{center}

\noindent Notice in the question it says that the radius \textbf{increases at a rate of 0.02 cm/min}. This basically gives us the derivative; whenever you see
'rate', it refers to the derivative. We are also given the radius.

\begin{center}
    \underline{given:}
    \begin{multicols}{2}
        $\frac{dr}{dt}=0.02 \frac{cm}{min}$

        $r=60cm$
    \end{multicols}
\end{center}

\noindent The question asks us \textbf{what rate is the plate's area increasing} when the radius is 60cm? Again, it is asking for the 'rate', so they are asking
for the derivative:

\begin{center}
    \underline{want:} \\
    \vspace*{1mm}
    $\frac{dA}{dt}=?$ \\
    \vspace*{1mm}
    A.T.I when r = 60 cm
\end{center}

\noindent Next, we need to find an equation that relates the area and the radius. Since we are working with circles, we already know this formula.

\begin{center}
    $A=\pi r^2$
\end{center}

\noindent Since we want $\frac{dA}{dt}$, we can simply take the derivative of this formula with respect to $t$ and after, plug in what we are given. \textbf{NOTE:} in the last line, remember that
we are taking the derivative with respect to $t$, so we cannot simply use the power rule.

\begin{center}
    $\frac{d}{dt}(A=\pi r^2)$ \\
    \vspace*{1mm}
    $\frac{dA}{dt}=2 \pi r \frac{dr}{dt}$ \\
    \vspace*{1mm}
    $\frac{dA}{dt}=2 \pi (60cm)(0.02\frac{cm}{min})$ \\
    \vspace*{1mm}
    $\frac{dA}{dt}=2.4 \pi \frac{cm^2}{min}$ \\
\end{center}

\noindent $\therefore$ At the instant when the radius is 60cm, the rate of which the plate's area is increasing by is $2.4 \pi \frac{cm^2}{min}$.

\noindent {\large \textbf{Example 2: Pythagorean}}

\noindent\small{Car A is travelling west at 50 mi/h and Car B is travelling north at 60 mi/h. Both are headed for the intersection of the two roads. At what rate are
    the cars approaching each other when Car A is 0.3 mi and Car B is 0.4 mi from the intersection?}

\vspace*{2mm}

\noindent Let's start by drawing a diagram to have a better understanding of what's happening. We will indicate the parts that are changing with red arrows and
label all the information given at the instant (A.T.I) the question is asking for.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{Example4Pic.jpg}
\end{center}

\noindent Reading the question again it tells us the rate of which the cars are travelling with respect to time. \textbf{NOTE:} the length of A and B are actually
decreasing, so the derivative should be negative as the distance is getting shorter - easy to see from the diagram.

\pagebreak

\begin{center}
    \underline{given:}
    \begin{multicols}{4}
        $\frac{dA}{dt}=-50 \frac{mi}{h}$

        $\frac{dB}{dt}=-60 \frac{mi}{h}$

        $A=0.3mi$

        $B=0.4mi$
    \end{multicols}
\end{center}

\noindent The question also asks, 'at what rate are the cars approaching each other?':

\begin{center}
    \underline{want:} \\
    $\frac{dc}{dt}=?$
\end{center}

\noindent Now, we need an equation that relates A, B, and C. Since we are working with triangles, it should be easy to notice that we can use \text{pythagorean's theorem}.
Everything that we are given and need ($\frac{dA}{dt}$, $\frac{dB}{dt}$, etc) are the derivatives of these variables with respect to time. So let's take the derivative of both sides.

\begin{center}
    $A^2+B^2=C^2$ \\
    \vspace*{1mm}
    $\frac{d}{dt}(A^2+B^2=C^2)$ \\
    \vspace*{1mm}
    $2A\frac{dA}{dt}+2B\frac{dB}{dt}=2C\frac{dC}{dt}$
\end{center}

\noindent To reiterate, it is very important to double-check if the rates are positive or negative. If Car A was going in the opposite direction, the rate would be
positive as the length/distance of A would be increasing. In this case, both Car A and Car B are going towards the intersection; the length/distance of A and B are
getting shorter, hence why $\frac{dA}{dt}$ and $\frac{dB}{dt}$ are negative. Let's plug in what we know now.

\begin{center}
    $2(0.3mi)(-50\frac{mi}{h})+2(0.4\frac{mi}{h})(-60mi)=2C\frac{dC}{dt}$ \\
\end{center}

\noindent You should notice that we do not have the value of C yet. Here we can use the equation we got from pythagorean's theorem.

\begin{center}
    $A^2+B^2=C^2$ \\
    \vspace*{1mm}
    $(0.3mi)^2+(0.4mi)^2=C^2$ \\
    \vspace*{1mm}
    $0.25mi^2=C^2$ \\
    \vspace*{1mm}
    $C=0.5mi$
\end{center}

\noindent We can continue where we left off and plug in this C value.

\begin{center}
    $2(0.3mi)(-50\frac{mi}{h})+2(0.4mi)(-60\frac{mi}{h})=2(0.5mi)\frac{dC}{dt}$ \\
    \vspace*{1mm}
    $(0.6mi)(-50\frac{mi}{h})+(0.8mi)(-60\frac{mi}{h})=(1mi)\frac{dC}{dt}$ \\
    \vspace*{1mm}
    $-78\frac{mi^2}{h}=(mi)\frac{dC}{dt}$ \\
    \vspace*{1mm}
    $-78\frac{mi}{h}=\frac{dC}{dt}$
\end{center}

\noindent $\therefore$ The cars the approaching each other at a rate of 78 $\frac{mi}{h}$.

\pagebreak

\noindent {\large \textbf{Example 3: Volume of Cone}}

\noindent {\small A water tank has the shape of an inverted (meaning up-side down) circular cone with base radius 2m and height 4m.
    If water is being pumped into the tank  at a rate of $2m^3/min$, find the rate at which the water level is rising when the water is 3m deep.}

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{Example5Pic.jpg}
\end{center}

\noindent In the diagram, whatever is changing as time passes by is indicated in red (the height - $h$ and radius - $r$). We are given a rate: 'water is being pumped into the tank at a rate of 2
$\frac{m^3}{min}$. This is our $\frac{dV}{dt}$ as it is the rate of which the volume is changing as time passes by. We want to find 'the rate at which the water level is rising', which is
$\frac{dh}{dt}$; the rate at which the height is changing as time passes by.

\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{center}
        \underline{given:} \\
        $\frac{dV}{dt}=2\frac{m^3}{min}$

        \columnbreak
        \underline{want:} \\
        \vspace*{1mm}
        $\frac{dA}{dt}=?$ \\
        \vspace*{1mm}
        {\small A.T.I when h = 3m}
    \end{center}
\end{multicols}

\noindent Like the previous examples on related rates, we need to find an equation that can relate all of the variables together (V, r, h). We can use the volume of a cone formula: $V=\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2h$.
Like before, we need this in terms of only one variable. In the diagram there are two \emph{similar} triangles that can be used to set up a \textbf{proportion} - this is why it is important to draw a diagram.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{Example5Pic2.jpg} \\
    \vspace*{2mm}
    $\frac{2}{4}=\frac{r}{h}$ \\
    \vspace*{1mm}
    $\frac{1}{2}=\frac{r}{h}$ \\
    \vspace*{1mm}
    $r=\frac{1}{2}h$
\end{center}

\pagebreak

\noindent We can use this in the formula to get it in terms of one variable. After that, we can take the derivative of both sides, plug in what we are given, and solve for $\frac{dh}{dt}$.

\begin{center}
    $V_{cone}=\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h$ \\
    \vspace*{2mm}
    $V=\frac{1}{3} \pi (\frac{1}{2}h)^2 h$ \\
    \vspace*{2mm}
    $V=\frac{1}{3} \pi \frac{1}{4}h^2h$\\
    \vspace*{2mm}
    $\frac{d}{dt}(V=\frac{1}{12} \pi h^3)$ \\
    \vspace*{2mm}
    $\frac{dV}{dt}=\frac{3}{12} \pi h^2 \frac{dh}{dt}$ \\
    \vspace*{2mm}
    $2=\frac{1}{4} \pi (3)^2 \frac{dh}{dt}$ \\
    \vspace*{2mm}
    $2=\frac{9 \pi}{4} \frac{dh}{dt}$ \\
    \vspace*{2mm}
    $\frac{dh}{dt}=\frac{8}{9 \pi} \frac{m}{min}$
\end{center}

\noindent $\therefore$ The water level is rising at a rate of $\frac{8}{9 \pi} \frac{m}{min}$ when the water is 3m deep.

\section{L'Hopital's Rule (AP)}\index{Related Rates}

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{LHopital.JPG}

\noindent L'Hopital's rule provides us a technique to \textbf{calculate the limit of indeterminate forms.} ($\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, $\frac{0}{0}$) When you have an indeterminate form, you can simply take the limit
of the derivative of the numerator divided by the derivative of the denominator. We can use L'Hopital's rule on the following forms:

\begin{multicols}{2}
    \begin{center}
        {\large$\frac{\infty}{\infty}$

            $\frac{0}{0}$}
    \end{center}
\end{multicols}

\noindent If you have other indeterminate forms, you can manipulate it to a form where you \emph{can} apply L'Hopital's rule.
